\section{\sc Recent Experience}
{\bf Research Intern}\hfill May, 2017 - Present\\  
Complex Systems Lab@ IIIT-Delhi \hfill Principal Investigator: {\href{https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=qyth_0QAAAAJ&hl=en}{\color{blue} Dr. Ganesh Bagler}}\\
During the course of summer '17 we worked on a project involving prediction of side effects using existing data (SIDER4) by leveraging machine learning with statistical data analysis. The entire work has been consolidated, documented \& open-sourced on github ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\color{blue}drugADR}}). \\
{\bf Research-Presentation}\hfill 2-5 December, 2015\\
XXVII IUPAP Conference on Computational Physics {\hfill}IIT Guwahati\\
Gave an oral talk on, ``Study of Random Numbers \& their applications in computational physics using Monte-Carlo method". ({\href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8hsJozmBILETlV3VVQ3S21NLTg}{\color{blue} Abstract}})({\href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8hsJozmBILEcGRiT2VzZ0hFUEE}{\color{blue} Certificate}})

\section{\sc Technical Skills}
{\bf Strongest Areas}: Machine Learning (Classification, Regression, Feature Engineering), Algorithms, Statistical Data Analysis\\
{\bf Languages/Tools/Software}: Python (scikit-learn, Keras, NumPy, Pandas \& others), Java, SQL, MongoDB, \LaTeX, MS Excel

\section{\sc Selected Projects}
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/VQAMD}{\color{blue} VQAMD}*}}\\
A semester long project (currently half way through) based on the Virginia Tech's {\href{http://visualqa.org/}{\color{blue} VQA}} (Version 2). Idea is to design a CNN + LSTM based model whose outputs are passed through a fully connected followed by softmax layer to improvise the overall accuracy on v2 release of VQA. \\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\color{blue} drugADR}}}\\
An open sourced consolidated version of the work done during my Summer Internship at IIIT-Delhi. The idea behind this research project was to leverage machine learning to predict phenotypic side effects of drugs using their chemcical properties.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{\color{blue} Kaggle-Repository}*}}\\
A collection of kernels (written in IPython Notebooks \& scripts) designed from datasets obtained from Kaggle for practise as well as competitions. These include implementations of typical Machine Learning algorithms on a range of datasets.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\color{blue} TheTwitterPolice}}}\\
Analysis of law enforcement activity on Twitter in India. Collected data from five different police social handles (BeautifulSoup \& Selenium), stored them in a database (MongoDB), analysed (sentiment-analysis, time-series etc) \& displayed the results graphically in the form of a web-app (flask application deployed on heroku).\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Image-Apportionor}{\color{blue} Image Apportionor}}}\\
A simple clustering based image segmentation in Python. Implemented k-means clustering for segmentation \& achieved a compression ratio of approximately 6.\\
\textit{*Ongoing}\\
All my projects (above included) are be available on {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa}{\color{blue}GitHub}}
