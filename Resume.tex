\section{\sc Selected Projects}
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{\color{blue} Kaggle-Repository}*}}\\
A collection of kernels (written in IPython Notebooks \& scripts) designed from datasets obtained from Kaggle for practise as well as competitions. These include implementations of typical Machine Learning algorithms on a range of datasets.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\color{blue} TheTwitterPolice}}}\\
Analysis of law enforcement activity on Twitter in India. Collected data from five different police social handles (BeautifulSoup \& Selenium), stored them in a database (MongoDB), analysed (sentiment-analysis, time-series etc) \& displayed the results graphically in the form of a web-app (flask application deployed on heroku).\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Image-Apportionor}{\color{blue} Image Apportionor}}}\\
A simple clustering based image segmentation in Python. Implemented k-means clustering for segmentation \& achieved a compression ratio of approximately 6.\\
